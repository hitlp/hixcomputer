A Retro Computer

Hello guys,

This project is, above all, a personal accomplishment, with the intention of "building things". My favorite disciplines have always been architecture of computers and operating systems.

Through this project, I decided to join the two subjects to study, to learn and, as incredible as it seemed, to have fun too. :)

The choice of the 6502 processor was strategic for several reasons. It has ample "open" documentation and easy access, has been used in several historical computers such as AppleII, Commodore 64 and Atari. This already makes it an important milestone for our current technology.
